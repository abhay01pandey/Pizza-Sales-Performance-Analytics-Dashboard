# Pizza Sales & Performance Analytics Dashboard
This project showcases a dynamic Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and optimize the sales performance of a pizza restaurant. By transforming raw sales data into actionable insights, this dashboard empowers business owners and managers to understand customer behavior, identify popular products, and make data-driven decisions that enhance profitability, streamline operations, and boost customer satisfaction.
# Project Overview
Situated with a need to better understand sales patterns and customer preferences, the Task was to build a comprehensive analytics dashboard. Action was taken by using SQL to clean and prepare the raw data, and then leveraging Power BI to create interactive visualizations that highlight key performance metrics. The Result is a user-friendly tool that provides a clear, 360-degree view of the business, from daily order trends to top-selling pizza categories.
# Key Features
 * Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Tracks total revenue, average order value, total pizzas sold, average pizzas per order, and total orders at a glance.
